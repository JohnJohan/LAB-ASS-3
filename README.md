SOFT ENG LAB 2

Background: Municipalities and cities face significant challenges in managing and efficiently
disposing of waste. Traditional waste collection methods often result in delays, inefficiencies,
and high operational costs. An innovative solution is needed to automate the waste
management process, ensuring timely collection and disposal while optimizing resource
utilization.

Objective: Develop an automated waste management system that uses a chain of
responsibility pattern to ensure efficient waste collection and disposal. The system should
handle different types of waste containers and trigger appropriate disposal actions based on the
type and capacity of each container.
